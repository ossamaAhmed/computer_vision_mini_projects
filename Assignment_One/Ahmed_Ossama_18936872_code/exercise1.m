%This function displays the calibration image and allows the user to click
%in the image to get the input points. Left click on the chessboard corners
%and type the 3D coordinates of the clicked points in to the input box that
%appears after the click. You can also zoom in to the image to get more
%precise coordinates. To finish use the right mouse button for the last
%point.
%You don't have to do this all the time, just store the resulting xy and
%XYZ matrices and use them as input for your algorithms.
